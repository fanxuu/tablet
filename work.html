The current process takes at least 4 weeks to finish one reimburesement. Several stakeholders have to check and sign on the request forms. Meanwhile, paper works get lost during the process. We conducted interviews, analyzed data and figured out solutions.</div>

                <div class="project_text">Loomo is a personal companion robot. I led the design of several main features of Loomo such as locking function, gallery, etc. When I found that many users who have purchased Loomo were also users of Apple Watch, I designed Loomo App for Apple watch. I also expanded Loomoâ€™s Drag-and-Drop Programming features that allow users to teach Loomo new tricks without any programming background knowledge. Some of our customers bought Loomo due to the possibilities this function brought to non-programmers.</div>

I was in charge of UX design and project management relevant to delivery robots and the robot station. I designed the workflow of robots, user flow, interaction, the monitoring platform, etc. The staff in the office reception room no longer need to run around the building all day and robots will do that. The most fun part was to figure out how people interact with robots.</div>
