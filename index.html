            <div class="tiny_title">Former Work</div>
            <p>I was working as the UX Designer at Segway-Ninebot from 2018 to 2020. This experience gave me insight and helped me to explore the relationship between people and technology. I seized every opportunity to meet users and tried to make a difference to Loomo's user experience. (Loomo is a personal companion robot.) I also got the opportunity to explore the commercial and industrial setting. When Loomo project was finished, I joined the delivery robot team and I was responsible for exploring how to use robots to save manpower in office buildings. </p>
