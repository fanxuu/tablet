        <div><p class="tiny_title">The story</p></div>
        <div><p>Two years ago, my friend and I were walking on the road, and a beautiful little white cat followed us back home. My friend wanted to adopt her, so we took her to the pet hospital for examination, and we were suprised to find that this little white cat was actually pregnant! Although my friend and I have no experience, we decided without hesitation to take care of her and her babies. Later, the white cat gave birth to four kittens smoothly. I adopted this orange one, and other kittens we have also found families willing to raise them.<br><br>My cat has a very important meaning to me. Last year I worked in a city far away from home. I had few friends there and was under a lot of pressure. However, whenever I got home, I could see my cat meowing at me at the door. She was like a light in the dark that supports me all the time. She is as important as my family.<br><br>I was planning to bring her to the United States with me, but because of the epidemic, I was unable to take her on international flights. She now lives in my parents' house. Although I can't see her, I know that she is very happy and safe. I hope that one day I can have the opportunity to bring her over. Here are the best shots of her, I hope you enjoy it!</p></div>
